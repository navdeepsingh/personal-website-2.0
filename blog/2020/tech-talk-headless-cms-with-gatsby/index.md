Headless CMS means the CMS without frontend. That means we have freedom to choose frontend framework of our choice. I am always fascinated about automation and independence in coding and in my personal life too. This makes me to take bold step in creating official client website which has backend WordPress and frontend is of my choice which is Reactjs.\
\
The tech-stack is being used as follows:

1. **WordPress** - REST API enabled
2. **Gatsby** - Using *GraphQL* communicates with Backend on build time
3. **Frontend** - Minimal HTML/CSS/JS files as Static Site.

**Result:** Highly performance website and client become fan of it.\
