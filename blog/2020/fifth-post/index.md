Google I/O Conference is the largest developer conference that’s is being held every year in Shoreline Theatre, Mountain View, CA, USA. With God’s grace and Mother's blessings, I got a chance to attend this conference from 7 May to 9 May 2019. The reason I being selected by Google India Skill Program is because I am a holder of Google’s Mobile Web Specialist Certification, which I had done the last year 2018 and my name is recommended by Google’s Certification Team. To know about that journey here is [Medium post link](https://medium.com/@singhnavdeep/dream-in-years-plan-in-months-evaluate-in-weeks-ship-daily-5e44fdf8eea1).

    Its wrap-up day. Completed my all code labs and collected one of the last 4th stickers from[ Jessica](https://twitter.com/chatasweetie) and put in my card into a lucky draw box, to get an I/O ticket for next year. Then afterward attended a workshop with Sarah Clark - the Program Manager at Google Developer Training and she collected our reviews about a new website that is going to be launch soon for developers called google.dev likely it's UI/UX and there Moto was “CELEBRATE THE CODE WE SHARE”

    I tried to cover many things and get hands-on experience on various latest innovations by Googlers. Some useful links:

    * The Amazing stuff is summarized by`The Try Guys `is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6el3-VHQv8) Must watch stuff.
    * No time, No worries. [Google I/O 2019 event in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm2v6IpKXI4)

    What I learned is "`Doing is the Mantra`” because when you start doing stuff, the community is there to help you and grow you.

    Wish me the best of luck for next year Google I/O 2020.
