<u>9 May:</u><br>
Its wrap-up day, completed my all code labs and collected one of last 4th sticker from [Jessica](https://twitter.com/chatasweetie) and put in my card into lucky draw box, to get I/O ticket for next year.
Then afterwards attended workshop with Sarah Clark - the Program Manager at Google Developer Training and she collected our reviews about new website that is going to be launch soon for developers called google.dev likely its UI/UX and there Moto was ‚ÄúCELEBRATE THE CODE WE SHARE‚Äù

I tried to cover much things and get hands-on experience on various latest innovations by Googlers. 
Some useful links:
* [Google I/O 2019 All Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILVTiOlMJdo7RQS55jYhsMi) 
* The Amazing stuff is summarized by `The Try Guys` is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6el3-VHQv8) Must watch stuff.
* No time, No worries. [Google I/O 2019 event in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm2v6IpKXI4)

What I learnt is "`Doing is the Mantra`‚Äù because when you start doing stuff, community is there to help you and grow you.

Wish me best of luck for next year Google I/O 2020.
