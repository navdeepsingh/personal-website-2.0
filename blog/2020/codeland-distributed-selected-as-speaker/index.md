Super excited to announce on social media that I am selected as a Speaker in Codeland DISTRIBUTED Conference - the meeting spot for programmers and their peers on 24th July 2020.\
\
I'm hosting a workshop based on "**Intro to Web Accessibility** ‚ôø" of about 2-3 hours long.

This workshop will cover the techniques to make your app accessible from day one. You'll walk away understanding accessibility guidelines, tools, and testing.

In this workshop you will learn:

* How to build accessible apps and websites that are not just for specially abled persons on day one
* Why accessible websites improve web performance and user experience too
* How to understand accessibility guidelines and incorporate accessibility-forward features into your code. ‚Ä¶ and more!
